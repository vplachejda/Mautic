1. Go to Mautic Settings ¬ª Click the cogwheel on the right-hand top corner 
2. Open the Plugins Directory ¬ª click on "Plugins" inside the menu
3. Find the GrapesJs Plugin and click on it ¬ª Click "No" and then "Save and Close"
4. Clear the cache

Mautic unloaded the GrapesJs Plugin and uses the legacy builder again.

## Code
### Setup 
```bash
npm install
```

#### Configure babel, eslint, prettier
use the template files provided. E.g. .eslintrc.temp

### How to develop and test Grapesjs standalone
```bash
# for the bare grapesjs editor
npm run start-helloWorld

# or for the light mautic experience (no dynamic content)
npm run start-mautic

# or for the full mautic experience
npm run start-mautic-full
```

#### Hints
- In order for start-mautic* to work a running ddev container has to be present. 
- If you are on some other development environment you need to update some paths in the html files. E.g. Demo/mautic/index.html
- Tell Chrome to ignore cors issues: ?open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security?

### How to build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Code Architecture

There is the JS code in the Assets/libarary folder. This handles the bootstrapping and management. 

In addition there is the mautic preset. This handles the basic Mautic specific code. The general idea is that this preset repo can be used as a base for various Mautic builder plugins. E.g one where the RTE ediotor is the CKEditor, or where we have some very customer specific functionality.
```
- It's a pack of configurable feautures:
- Adds the function to edit source code
- Extends the original image and add a confirm dialog before removing it
- Add the option to hide/show the Layers Manager
- Add the option to enable/disable the import code button
- Moves the Settings panel inside Style Manager panel
- Opens the Block Manager at launch
- Replace Rich Text Editor by Froala used in Mautic (add token support)
- Add Dynamic Content Block for HTML used in Mautic
```
